My name is Corban Nemeth and I'm a Policy & Data Analyst for the State of Washington and a graduate student in Public Administration at The Evergreen State College. I get excited about the intersection of data, decision-making, and policy design. On this site, you'll find blog posts on things I find interesting and assorted projects from my graduate program and career.
