# On Debates

## A Perspective from a 4-year old
I’m currently reading *These Truths* by Jill Lepore. It’s a fascinating look at the history of the United States. In it, she explains the first televised “debate” between Nixon and Kennedy. They agreed to the rules in advance— both agreed that the camera would avoid them mopping sweat off their televised faces. However, she notes that they are not debated in the truest sense of the word. 

It seems strange to me to set up a system called debate that actively discouraged debate. One of the peculiarities of modern politics. I recall a *Freakonomics* episode from forever ago *(with Adam Grant? I don’t remember offhand)* where the host discussed better ways to gauge the proclivities of politicians. I think one of the suggestions was board games. I would’ve loved to see Biden and Bernie duke it out over house-rules Monopoly. DNC, get in touch if you want to roll this out. 

I’m trying to think of a better word for the spectacle that American voters eagerly subject themselves to several times per election cycle. We rarely have the TV on in our house. I can't remember the last time I sat down to watch something for myself with my daughter in the room. 

> *Dad, what are you watching?* 

I regret calling it *the news* to my daughter. I can’t decide if it’s a complement or an insult to **real** cable news. The common denominator is pundits that tell the viewers what to think, rather than how to decide for themselves. 

I did decide one critical thing— for both news and debate— last night. If Chuck Todd is there, I’m out. Or at least I want to be out. But like everyone else, I can’t look away. 

Cynicism aside, what does a presidential debate mean for my four-year-old? She will be eligable to vote in the year 2033. Good god, that feels like a long time. 

By the time she is eligable to vote, the Green New Deal calls for a net-zero in greenhouse gas emmissions by the year 2030. What does a world look like where that is the case? I have no idea. All I know is that it's a sham that climate only got 15 minutes of time in four hours of debate.
