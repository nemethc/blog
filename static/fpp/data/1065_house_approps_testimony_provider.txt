Good afternoon chair arms of the members of the Committee for the record Shon Graham on behalf of the Washington State Medical Association representing more than eleven thousand physician of position and assistance from across the state side in other on hospital turn sixty five do want to thank Representative Cody and the other proponents of the bill there's been a lot of work that has gone into this over the years and I think talked with many if not all of you about how this is this has been and remains a priority issue for the Washington State Medical Association one that we would like to see resolved our top line goal in approaching this issue has been mean ensuring that the incentives to contract between physicians and insurance carriers are retained on passage of the bill that's something that we as a really is a top priority for the medical association physicians have a lot of natural incentives to want to contract with insurance carriers we need to make sure that those are retained on both sides we think that the bill this bill reflects in.

Improvement in approach over previous iterations we do think that there's a little more work that needs to be done and want to be conscious of the fact that this is the fiscal committee will save those days for subsequent discussion and policy committees.

But again we're on the right path and from the dismay standpoint committed to making sure that this gets done this year I want to be a resource of anybody has questions or concerns about this issue thank you thank you. 

Thank you Mr Chairman members of the Committee for the record has been really here on behalf of the Washington State Hospital Association also testifying other on this legislation I would reflect and concur with the sentiments of my colleague Mr Graham both in thanking representative Cody and many of the other members of this committee in front of me for their good work on this legislation thus far I think that the bill is in better shape than in previous years and like Mr Graham though I do believe it needs more work there mostly of a policy nature is all refrain here but I would note that from a fiscal perspective if the contracting incentives that Mr Graham spoke about are tilted in a way that is harmful to the provider community that would have impact on the finance of up finances of a hospital system that does include public hospital districts and the taxpayers that fund them but again we're trying to help work to perfect this long running legislation and hope to see something get done this year thank you very much thank you.
