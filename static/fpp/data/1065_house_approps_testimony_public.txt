director of Northwest health law advocates an organization advocated for access to health care we strongly support House bill ten sixty five a bill that takes consumers out of the middle of disputes between providers and insurers However we do have six serious concerns about the amendment that was recently attached to the bill to allow for an opt out of these important consumer protections while it characterizes the opt out as a choice we fear that same some of the same problems that are coming out now will come up problems that this bill intends to solve people who might opt out because they don't understand the costs and cost differential procedure.
