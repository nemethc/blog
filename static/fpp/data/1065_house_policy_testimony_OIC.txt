 24:36
The our bill to in the practice of surprise spelling the staff's done a great job of going over the technical aspects of this Jane is going to go over the highlights I'm just going to tell you briefly what we have been busy doing this past interim which was to really look at what all the other states have been doing how their implementation is going what the states that recently passed it have done what they were doing differently meeting with both consumers and the proponent the issuers and the providers in several meetings to discuss what their ideas are and we continued right up to as recently as a couple of days ago to meet with and discuss particular proposed amendments to the legislation before you and we're happy to continue to do that but we do believe that this is a practice that time has come to end in our state has as it has it and many others with that I'm going to turn it over to Jane his going to tell you about the updates and then you will have the great pleasure of hearing from Mrs Sampson.

 26:23
And we thank you for giving the time to this important bill today that I think that all of us know about the scope of this problem national studies indicate that about twenty percent of network hospital emergency department visits involve an out of network physician and potential balance filling a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated that for people in rolled in large employer health plans nearly one in five inpatient hospital admissions involved a claim for an out of network provider we continue to get numerous consumer complaints at oh I see related to receiving balance bills and I think when you hear from Ms Hanson you'll understand the nature of the kinds of complaints that we're getting and ultimately the commissioner's goal as he has said throughout the efforts to get legislation like this passed is that we want to take the consumer out of the middle of the dispute between insurers and providers I think all of us would agree that it is unrealistic to expect a consumer who's walked into a hospital or been brought into a hospital whether for an emergency procedure or even for a planned procedure to know that them have fallen just the radiologists anesthesiologist may not be in their health plans network. 
 27:50
As Loni indicated we've been doing a lot of research on what other states have done on surprise billing eleven states have enacted legislation as the post here that prohibits balance filling in a number of situations and we've looked a lot at Missouri New Jersey New Hampshire and Oregon since a passer bills in twenty eighteen and we actually have a link in these slides to a Commonwealth Fund study that literally was published yesterday that's an update on what other states have doing are doing and in that sly they have they in that study they have indicators of what they would consider to be a comprehensive balanced billing proposal and we're happy to say that what we have in front of you today meets all of those standards for a comprehensive proposal should be so we want to talk a little bit about the changes in the legislation from last year to this year we can say that there is no change in the scope of the prohibition on balance billing so we're still talking about out of network services provided in either an in network or out of network Amergin see situation and for non-emergency situations out of network services provided by surgeons pathologists radiologists pathologists medical labs and it's easy allergists we are as we know that there was a lot of debate last session about what formulas should be for payment of out of network providers after going through I don't know how many variations on a formula we could not reach agreement between the stakeholders and so we've actually borrowed New Hampshire's approach which is to say that the out of network payment is limited to a commercially reasonable amount on the assumption that an insurer and a provider can each bring to the table information which we're actually going to. 
 29:50
Providing to them via a data set from the all payer claims database if they cannot reach an agreement on what that amount should be then the decision is to go to arbitration to try to arbitrate that dispute we've retained the concept of the arbitrator chooses one want either the insurers last offer or the Dr is a last offer and but the one change that we did have is rather than saying that the loser pays for the cost of the arbitration we have each side. 
 30:23
Paying half of the cost of the arbitration and the goal in all of this is to essentially do whatever we can to incentivize the change incentivize the insurance company in the provider to reach a reasonable agreement without having to pursue costly arbitration we did in response to a request from stakeholders we modified the factors that an arbitrator considers to include what the median billed charge is for that service that said issue but to balance that out by also having the arbitrator know what Medicare would pay so they're getting they're getting a balanced perspective of what has been paid for a particular service that's at issue and we continue to allow a provider to bundle multiple claims in an arbitration proceeding. 
 31:12
We know that there have been some concerns that have been expressed from both providers and carriers on that issue and so continue to have discussions we spend a lot of time over the interim with the Department of Health and the medical quality assurance folks so that they would be comfortable with the language in the bill are around enforcement remember that oh I see doesn't have in force an authority over hospitals doctors and so the bill relies upon the Department of Health to enforce violations by providers we modify the bill to say will only be for a provider. 
 31:50
Facility for enforcement if there's a pattern of violations I.E. not one single violation and oh I see will reach out to that provider and say we've gotten a complaint we think you are Roni Asli balance bill this person do you want to fix that situation we'd love to have you comply with the law and not have to refer this over to the Department of Health and fine and we made the same concept of pattern of violations of the body carriers as well as providers and we also barred from New Jersey an opportunity for self funded health plans which we are not allowed to regulate under a recess to opt into the provisions of the bill so that if they want to offer their employees those protections they have the opportunity to do that so we will end where as I say as Loni indicated we're speaking with stakeholders who are likely going to come forward with some propose committing amendments most importantly as you'll hear Mrs Hanson discuss we will be asking for a modification in the bill to be sure that when a consumer is receiving emergency services in an out of network hospital that in a bordering state we can still keep consumers protected from receiving balanced bills so with that conclude my testimony this is a handsome.
