Chair Cody members of the Committee for the record I make Jones on behalf of the Association of Washington health care pliant plans and as you said we are signed in as other on House bill ten sixty five on behalf of our members I want to express the fact that we support efforts to ban balance or surprise billing where an out of network provider member demands payment from their patient above the amount paid under the patient's health care coverage House bill ten sixty five provides a good framework to address this problem and we appreciate the opportunities provided by the bill's sponsor to provide common input on the bill based on the bill before us however the associations membership does have some concerns that we ask the sponsor to address the bill currently bans balance or surprise billing for all out of network providers and facilities we ask that an exclusion be written into the bill for situations where in rolling knowingly in voluntarily receive services out of network when and then work option is available and that the bill protect those who receive out of network services in an emergency situation where they have no control over the provider scheduled or assigned by the hospital to perform surgery or other services.

We would also note that our members report member complaints about balance billing by ambulance service providers and we again would like to reiterate as we have over the summer in working with folks that that those services be included in the bill another concern that we'd like to share involves the provision in Section eight of the bill permitting an arbitrator to review multiple claims for similar or related C.P.T. codes for procedures performed within three months of each other we ask that each claim be considered on its own merit which is how in network claims are processed normally for in network providers in addition by permitting out of network providers to collect claims and present them in a group there is a lot lower incentive for them to actually negotiate an appropriate and reasonable commercial rate with carriers because they will just wait for arbitration and deal with that. 
 44:12
That adds administrative costs that are unnecessary to the system and we think an easy solution is to simply eliminate the bundling and the bill we would again like to express our appreciation of the sponsor for working with us on this issue and we look forward to an acceptable resolution. 
 44:28
We need and we want to express again our support for a solution to balance filling that doesn't incentivize providers or facilities to remain out of network that protect certain Rowley's from services when they're at their most vulnerable and is not necessarily at administrative costs Thank you. 
 44:46
And I think Madam Chair members like maybe Lance or and on behalf of from Arab across with you today joining Meghan Zach in testifying other I think for the first time on a balance billing Bill. 
 45:00
We first chair Cody and I and a number of others were first in a room talking about this I think in two thousand and ten down your county Yes You know well and it's been a while and I appear before you today I think with a greater sense of optimism about our ability to collectively reach a conclusion that number one and most importantly takes consumers out of the middle of these sorts of disputes we don't want any more stories like Mrs Hanson told you today and nor does anyone else in the room. 
 45:32
We do think it's important number one the members be taken out of the middle and that number two we don't unduly disrupt the contracting dynamic so that health plans are able to continue to build robust networks to service our members. 
 45:48
We look forward to continuing our conversations with the chair with the insurance commissioner and others and we're very hopeful that we can come out of the session this year with the bill doing away with this with this practice Thank you care Codee members of the committee as Exide are appearing today on behalf of Regents Blue Shield like my colleagues on the panel have said were here other but hopeful that we can find a solution this session to finally end the practice of balance billing and like others have said take the member out of the middle so we hope to continue working with you and I don't need to reiterate the points but disagree with my colleagues up here thank you OK thank you for.
