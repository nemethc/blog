Good afternoon Madam Chair members of committee for the record Shawn Graham with the Washington State Medical Association here signed and also as other on house built in sixty five and I want to knowledge you know I think we've had conversations with you know basically everybody who's up here on this issue and I know that we've testified many times on this is you have to little bit of like like The Who or something like we're on a farewell tour that just you know there's an end I hope it's a farewell tour. 
 47:17
This is and that's you know it's underscore the point that's been made by others I think we share the optimism that this year we can get this resolved this is and remains it has been and remains a priority issue for the Washington State Medical Association. 
 47:32
And the focus that we've brought into it is kind of twofold agreeing on wanting to take the patients out of the middle that they shouldn't be subject to these situations and also maintaining those incentives to contract physicians have a lot of natural incentives to contract and it's need we need that the legislative solution to keep those in place for both sides I know we did some research of our own over the interim talking to our counterparts in states that have passed balanced bill in bills and came to a similar conclusion that legislation that focuses on creating a structure where you're incenting the two sides to come to contract rather than trying to fix a rate or mechanism in statute real. 
 48:15
Scenario that retains those incentives to contract there are a couple of elements of the bill that we are particularly pleased to see retained the one that has been mentioned previously the claims bundling component allowing providers and facilities to consider multiple claims in arbitration at one time it's very important because oftentimes the discrepancy is going to be fairly nominal on a claim by claim basis but over the course of several weeks or months the accumulation of that is going to be considerable So if you were to try to arbitrate this on a claim by claim big. 
 48:50
This the cost of arbitration would outstrip the difference between what the reimbursement is and what the the bill is so that ability that efficiency in trying to in being able to consider them concurrently bundling those claims is very important the other piece is important this is come up in a number of ways already in this hearing is the never got to proceed component of the bill is something that we feel very strongly about and appreciate the improved protections around network adequacy asking the insurance commissioner to consider that situation where if a carrier is contracted with a hospital are they also contracted with the physicians who are working in the hospital we do have I mean we are signing other we do have some suggestions some pieces that we would like to continue to work on the initial reimbursement that is to Pilate in the bill we want to make sure that there is no loaded language that's balanced that it doesn't favor one side or the other we need to make sure that the transparency components in the bill are workable for providers and facilities and yield a couple of other components to my colleague from the hospital association but just want to end on noting that again this is something that we are confident that we can resolve this session and we are committed to doing so so really appreciate your consideration.

Thank you Madam Chair members of the committee Chris family here before you today on behalf of the Washington State Hospital Association we are joining the other parade on this legislation and I would echo honestly a lot of the comments that have been made by all of those of testified thus far in wanting to say thank you Madam Chair and to the office of insurance commissioner for the work they've done on this legislation that you've done in this legislation over the past year I think that the structure of the bill that we have before us today is greatly improved from the previous versions and that I think it does help take the consumer out of the middle and establishes something pretty close to a fair process for mitigating disputes and they do happen that said we do of course have a couple of concerns I do agree with everything that the medical association mentioned and would add to it to say couple areas where we'd like to continue the conversation of the first being the inclusion of Medicare as one the arbitration criteria the reimbursement of the bill is stipulated as commercially reasonable I believe is the term used and I think is widely acknowledged there's a pretty big gap between what Medicare reimburses and what commercial insurance reimburses for services so for us having That is an arbitration criteria doesn't really doesn't really make sense with trying to get to what would be a fair commercial reimbursement for the services rendered the second area is around the self funded plans I think Jane mentioned that this version of legislation allows self funded plans are self funded employers I should say to opt into the legislation which we have no problem with we just continue to be confused as to how are our members hospitals and providers are supposed to know whether someone who comes in through our doors is on a self funded plan or a fully insured plan where the protections do obviously apply it's not it's an insurance card as an insurance card it doesn't specify whether it's a Starbucks or you know a small manufacturing company that's fully insured so we're only asking that the bill put in for some to put in place some sort of process to make sure that our members can identify when this law applies and when it doesn't I would mention that the state we're. 
 52:06
Copying this from New Jersey in the rulemaking is requiring the insurer I believe is in court requiring insurance companies to add to both their insurance cards and to the payment remittance when they see whatever out of network amount they send letting the provider know whether or not the law there applies in that situation so again if you think this bill is moved in a positive direction and we are happy to continue being part of the conversation thank you Robin Schmidt has a question for you so why do you need to know when someone comes in whether their self funded plan and not is that a ticket to balance Bill thank you for the question Representative to make I would answer it this way I would say that this law sets inside this law has two parts the first of which is that it bans balance billing in certain situations and the second is that it puts in place a process for the provider to be reimbursed for the certain services they provided out of network if we only know one half of that equation which is that we care if only one half of that equation is in is being applied to Van On balance billing and the other half isn't that's not really I would say fair to the provider for the goal is for women out of network claim half happens in the consumer protection from balance billing for there to be some sort of fairy embarrassment to the provider if we don't know whether that person that whether that patient can or cannot be balance billed then we run the risk of having ours our claim sense of apartment health which is not something we really want to do so I have a question for both of you I guess. 
 53:36
Another option that has come that California has some of the hospitals in California are mandating that any doctor that practices in their hospital has to belong to the networks that the hospital belongs to have you guys considered that the two of you discuss that to a degree I know I've seen media saying that some hospital systems have adopted the policy I would note a couple of things this one this bill does help address that issue that network adequacy requirement that's included in the bills specifically ask the insurance commissioner's office to when a network is submitted if the hospital is contracted with the carrier that you need to look at the component parts of the hospital and make sure that they're in contracted status too so I think that that would go a long way to addressing it and I would know that there's you know there's a difference between a hospital setting that is a policy that a provider group would know upon taking you know upon and being employed or you know contracting with that facility and the state setting that in statute I think from again that incentive to contract. 
 54:51
Standpoint it would put the physician groups in a very difficult spot if there was a state law requiring their participation in the same networks as the hospitals I would just add to what Shawn said that most hospitals in Washington not all of them do strongly encourage the providers that not employ providers that work at their facilities to contract to the same insurance companies that they do however I would say that the hospitals are number one goal in trying in staffing their hospitals to staff it with high quality physicians to provide the care that our patients need.
