Good afternoon afternoon Cody and members of the committee My name is Jamie Hansen thank you for the opportunity is speak with you today and for taking the time to hear my story I'd like to start with a little bit of information about me I worked for fifteen years in the health care industry at a health plan in Oregon but we also provided coverage in Washington I was in charge of benefit clarification assisting with ensuring consistent benefit materials for our members and training providers on new benefits or changes in state laws regarding both benefits for both states I have been a widow for over three years and a breast cancer survivor for two.

While I've been out of the health care industry for over fifteen years in the last three years I have received quite the reeducation Fortunately my past experience has given me the ability to better understand the medical situations with which I have been faced especially the one we're here to talk about today they were here to discuss the balance or surprise billing I am my son experienced in July two thousand and eighteen from seeking services from an out of network provider but in an emergency situation of which we had no control.

It began with a visit to the Vancouver clinic my son had been ill for several days a while in Canada at a band camp I had to drive twenty hours to get him and bring him home when he was still not well the next morning and in fact seemed to be getting worse I called the advice nurse that are in that work clinic the Vancouver clinic and an appointment was made for that same day when examined by the physician it was determined he needed I.V. fluids and lab tests they could not provide in the office setting we were instructed to go to the emergency room at Pease health southwest Washington Medical Center which we did from previous experience of my own eye in two thousand and seventeen I am aware that while peace health is in network on my life wise plan the emergency room doctors are not so already at this point in the city in a story I am aware that I am looking at significant out of pocket costs for the services of the E.R. doctors over which I have no control while my son was given I.V. fluids in the E.R. the lab tests performed show that he needed more serious care I remember them telling me his trip home in levels were dangerously high for someone his age I was told this was due to an infection around his heart he had pretty severe pain in his hip meaning making it difficult to walk it was also determined he had a infection in his hip area I won't go into great detail to keep this brief because there is no dispute that he needed the care he was given when they began talking about admitting him I assumed they meant at peace health but was told No my son needed care only available at Randall Children's Hospital I informed them Randall was not in our network they assured me because it was an emergency admit it would be covered of course no one realised how little would be covered or the enormity of the out of pocket costs I would be facing not that it would have changed my decision in the least we were transported by ambulance to Randall where my son was placed in the pediatric I.C.U. He was there for four days and he also spent two days on the regular hospital floor until he was discharged he has made a full recovery and is doing great now. 
 36:30
Now we come to the billing phase of our story after some delay to confirm that that they are Randall admit was indeed an emergency the claims were processed as in that work and paid at the in network benefit level I was shocked at how little of the bill was covered at the same time frustration arises when you see the portion of the bill that was not paid the part of contractor provider would be compelled to write off. 
 36:56
I am told because lifeways does not have a contract with these providers they cannot prevent the providers from balance billing me just the hospital bill alone was over one hundred twelve thousand dollars life wise as initial payment was a little over fifteen thousand leaving me facing a balance of ninety six over ninety six thousand dollars this does not take into consideration the balances for all the doctors and other providers billing for their services so at that point I am looking at medical claims of about one hundred ten thousand dollars My son also needed follow up care from a pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric cardiologist neither of which is on the lifeways plan in my service area I was told by the case manager for legacy that there are no pediatric specialists in those areas of practice in Vancouver that all of the hospitals in the Portland Vancouver area send their patients to legacy I was given of benefit level exception by life was to have my son follow up with the specialists he has had seen as inpatient but again this would mean more balance filling from these providers so we only had one visit with them and I brought and then brought his care back into his primary care at the Vancouver clinic. 
 38:14
On my own I was able to negotiate with legacy and after much emphasis by me on my actual net income instead of gross and my list of other financial obligations they agreed to reduce their bill as it was I still needed to find out over thirty eight thousand dollars to pay everything off the hospital and all the ancillary services and I'm very lucky that I had that option available to me at the urging of the Washington insurance commissioner life has has reprocessed the cost little claim and has sent us another check bringing their payment to just over twenty five thousand leaving me responsible for the remaining eighty six thousand. 
 38:54
They have reviewed other claims they processed for my son services and some additional minor payments have been made it's extremely stressful to be in such a serious medical situation with your child and to also realize the insurance you have and have been paying for is not enough and the possibility of losing your home and or filing bankruptcy is quite real That's when I began to feel a little bit of panic one of the first things that struck me is how your hospital emergency room can be in that work and the doctors providing care in that exact emergency room are not in network and therefore are not covered at the same level if at all especially in a situation like the or emergency room where the heart the patient has no control over who they are seen for treatment also coming back to the reason I am here today when there are not adequate providers in the service area how is it that the consumer the patient is left holding the back like most people I believe that my health insurance would take care of the bulk of my services that's why I pay the large premiums so that I have less out of pocket expenses even when I'm following the guidelines of my health plan going to the providers on my health plan and doing the best to follow the rules I feel that the odds are stacked against me there is no way I can avoid these surprise costs and it's an expense and it's at the expense of my financial security I did all the right things and I made all the right decisions I am a person of moderate means.

My husband died three years ago and we depend on his retirement benefits I'm fortunate that because of that I'm able to focus on caring for our son and making sure he is taken care of and provide provided for the way his dad intended I thought I had good insurance last year of his life weighs over thirteen thousand dollars for it even with insurance if I had not been able to negotiate a reduction of this bill and several others they would have wiped me out even selling my house would not have taken care of all of it and we would have had no place to live what does a family less fortunate than me do maybe they have benefits from both start their jobs if there is a double income family maybe they don't what happens when their child needs is need specialized pediatric care and the only providers are out of network and here because I'm concerned about the next person who has to deal with this issue and isn't financially or emotionally prepared and doesn't have the background to know how to navigate our health care system thank you for your time today I'm grateful that you're listening to the issue and giving it the attention that it deserves and hopefully will make the changes that are necessary thank you and questions
