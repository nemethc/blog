The our bill to in the practice of surprise spelling the staff's done a great job of going over the technical aspects of this Jane is going to go over the highlights I'm just going to tell you briefly what we have been busy doing this past interim which was to really look at what all the other states have been doing how their implementation is going what the states that recently passed it have done what they were doing differently meeting with both consumers and the proponent the issuers and the providers in several meetings to discuss what their ideas are and we continued right up to as recently as a couple of days ago to meet with and discuss particular proposed amendments to the legislation before you and we're happy to continue to do that but we do believe that this is a practice that time has come to end in our state has as it has it and many others with that I'm going to turn it over to Jane his going to tell you about the updates and then you will have the great pleasure of hearing from Mrs Sampson. 
 25:41
Powerpoint presentation. 
 25:48
Actually you just go from this you're going supposed to have slides when it's a bill period so you have to just. 
 25:54
Think you never work here. 
 25:57
OK So just in terms of providing context there we have it here you have a handout OK great so in addition on sorry you see you just sort of confuse me good morning chair Cody and members of the committee the afternoon care quoting members of the committee My name is Jane buyer and I am commissioner Kreidler senior health policy adviser. 
 26:23
And we thank you for giving the time to this important bill today that I think that all of us know about the scope of this problem national studies indicate that about twenty percent of network hospital emergency department visits involve an out of network physician and potential balance filling a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated that for people in rolled in large employer health plans nearly one in five inpatient hospital admissions involved a claim for an out of network provider we continue to get numerous consumer complaints at oh I see related to receiving balance bills and I think when you hear from Ms Hanson you'll understand the nature of the kinds of complaints that we're getting and ultimately the commissioner's goal as he has said throughout the efforts to get legislation like this passed is that we want to take the consumer out of the middle of the dispute between insurers and providers I think all of us would agree that it is unrealistic to expect a consumer who's walked into a hospital or been brought into a hospital whether for an emergency procedure or even for a planned procedure to know that them have fallen just the radiologists anesthesiologist may not be in their health plans network. 
 27:50
As Loni indicated we've been doing a lot of research on what other states have done on surprise billing eleven states have enacted legislation as the post here that prohibits balance filling in a number of situations and we've looked a lot at Missouri New Jersey New Hampshire and Oregon since a passer bills in twenty eighteen and we actually have a link in these slides to a Commonwealth Fund study that literally was published yesterday that's an update on what other states have doing are doing and in that sly they have they in that study they have indicators of what they would consider to be a comprehensive balanced billing proposal and we're happy to say that what we have in front of you today meets all of those standards for a comprehensive proposal should be so we want to talk a little bit about the changes in the legislation from last year to this year we can say that there is no change in the scope of the prohibition on balance billing so we're still talking about out of network services provided in either an in network or out of network Amergin see situation and for non-emergency situations out of network services provided by surgeons pathologists radiologists pathologists medical labs and it's easy allergists we are as we know that there was a lot of debate last session about what formulas should be for payment of out of network providers after going through I don't know how many variations on a formula we could not reach agreement between the stakeholders and so we've actually borrowed New Hampshire's approach which is to say that the out of network payment is limited to a commercially reasonable amount on the assumption that an insurer and a provider can each bring to the table information which we're actually going to. 
 29:50
Providing to them via a data set from the all payer claims database if they cannot reach an agreement on what that amount should be then the decision is to go to arbitration to try to arbitrate that dispute we've retained the concept of the arbitrator chooses one want either the insurers last offer or the Dr is a last offer and but the one change that we did have is rather than saying that the loser pays for the cost of the arbitration we have each side. 
 30:23
Paying half of the cost of the arbitration and the goal in all of this is to essentially do whatever we can to incentivize the change incentivize the insurance company in the provider to reach a reasonable agreement without having to pursue costly arbitration we did in response to a request from stakeholders we modified the factors that an arbitrator considers to include what the median billed charge is for that service that said issue but to balance that out by also having the arbitrator know what Medicare would pay so they're getting they're getting a balanced perspective of what has been paid for a particular service that's at issue and we continue to allow a provider to bundle multiple claims in an arbitration proceeding. 
 31:12
We know that there have been some concerns that have been expressed from both providers and carriers on that issue and so continue to have discussions we spend a lot of time over the interim with the Department of Health and the medical quality assurance folks so that they would be comfortable with the language in the bill are around enforcement remember that oh I see doesn't have in force an authority over hospitals doctors and so the bill relies upon the Department of Health to enforce violations by providers we modify the bill to say will only be for a provider. 
 31:50
Facility for enforcement if there's a pattern of violations I.E. not one single violation and oh I see will reach out to that provider and say we've gotten a complaint we think you are Roni Asli balance bill this person do you want to fix that situation we'd love to have you comply with the law and not have to refer this over to the Department of Health and fine and we made the same concept of pattern of violations of the body carriers as well as providers and we also barred from New Jersey an opportunity for self funded health plans which we are not allowed to regulate under a recess to opt into the provisions of the bill so that if they want to offer their employees those protections they have the opportunity to do that so we will end where as I say as Loni indicated we're speaking with stakeholders who are likely going to come forward with some propose committing amendments most importantly as you'll hear Mrs Hanson discuss we will be asking for a modification in the bill to be sure that when a consumer is receiving emergency services in an out of network hospital that in a bordering state we can still keep consumers protected from receiving balanced bills so with that conclude my testimony this is a handsome. 
 33:14
Good afternoon afternoon Cody and members of the committee My name is Jamie Hansen thank you for the opportunity is speak with you today and for taking the time to hear my story I'd like to start with a little bit of information about me I worked for fifteen years in the health care industry at a health plan in Oregon but we also provided coverage in Washington I was in charge of benefit clarification assisting with ensuring consistent benefit materials for our members and training providers on new benefits or changes in state laws regarding both benefits for both states I have been a widow for over three years and a breast cancer survivor for two. 
 33:53
While I've been out of the health care industry for over fifteen years in the last three years I have received quite the reeducation Fortunately my past experience has given me the ability to better understand the medical situations with which I have been faced especially the one we're here to talk about today they were here to discuss the balance or surprise billing I am my son experienced in July two thousand and eighteen from seeking services from an out of network provider but in an emergency situation of which we had no control. 
 34:25
It began with a visit to the Vancouver clinic my son had been ill for several days a while in Canada at a band camp I had to drive twenty hours to get him and bring him home when he was still not well the next morning and in fact seemed to be getting worse I called the advice nurse that are in that work clinic the Vancouver clinic and an appointment was made for that same day when examined by the physician it was determined he needed I.V. fluids and lab tests they could not provide in the office setting we were instructed to go to the emergency room at Pease health southwest Washington Medical Center which we did from previous experience of my own eye in two thousand and seventeen I am aware that while peace health is in network on my life wise plan the emergency room doctors are not so already at this point in the city in a story I am aware that I am looking at significant out of pocket costs for the services of the E.R. doctors over which I have no control while my son was given I.V. fluids in the E.R. the lab tests performed show that he needed more serious care I remember them telling me his trip home in levels were dangerously high for someone his age I was told this was due to an infection around his heart he had pretty severe pain in his hip meaning making it difficult to walk it was also determined he had a infection in his hip area I won't go into great detail to keep this brief because there is no dispute that he needed the care he was given when they began talking about admitting him I assumed they meant at peace health but was told No my son needed care only available at Randall Children's Hospital I informed them Randall was not in our network they assured me because it was an emergency admit it would be covered of course no one realised how little would be covered or the enormity of the out of pocket costs I would be facing not that it would have changed my decision in the least we were transported by ambulance to Randall where my son was placed in the pediatric I.C.U. He was there for four days and he also spent two days on the regular hospital floor until he was discharged he has made a full recovery and is doing great now. 
 36:30
Now we come to the billing phase of our story after some delay to confirm that that they are Randall admit was indeed an emergency the claims were processed as in that work and paid at the in network benefit level I was shocked at how little of the bill was covered at the same time frustration arises when you see the portion of the bill that was not paid the part of contractor provider would be compelled to write off. 
 36:56
I am told because lifeways does not have a contract with these providers they cannot prevent the providers from balance billing me just the hospital bill alone was over one hundred twelve thousand dollars life wise as initial payment was a little over fifteen thousand leaving me facing a balance of ninety six over ninety six thousand dollars this does not take into consideration the balances for all the doctors and other providers billing for their services so at that point I am looking at medical claims of about one hundred ten thousand dollars My son also needed follow up care from a pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric cardiologist neither of which is on the lifeways plan in my service area I was told by the case manager for legacy that there are no pediatric specialists in those areas of practice in Vancouver that all of the hospitals in the Portland Vancouver area send their patients to legacy I was given of benefit level exception by life was to have my son follow up with the specialists he has had seen as inpatient but again this would mean more balance filling from these providers so we only had one visit with them and I brought and then brought his care back into his primary care at the Vancouver clinic. 
 38:14
On my own I was able to negotiate with legacy and after much emphasis by me on my actual net income instead of gross and my list of other financial obligations they agreed to reduce their bill as it was I still needed to find out over thirty eight thousand dollars to pay everything off the hospital and all the ancillary services and I'm very lucky that I had that option available to me at the urging of the Washington insurance commissioner life has has reprocessed the cost little claim and has sent us another check bringing their payment to just over twenty five thousand leaving me responsible for the remaining eighty six thousand. 
 38:54
They have reviewed other claims they processed for my son services and some additional minor payments have been made it's extremely stressful to be in such a serious medical situation with your child and to also realize the insurance you have and have been paying for is not enough and the possibility of losing your home and or filing bankruptcy is quite real That's when I began to feel a little bit of panic one of the first things that struck me is how your hospital emergency room can be in that work and the doctors providing care in that exact emergency room are not in network and therefore are not covered at the same level if at all especially in a situation like the or emergency room where the heart the patient has no control over who they are seen for treatment also coming back to the reason I am here today when there are not adequate providers in the service area how is it that the consumer the patient is left holding the back like most people I believe that my health insurance would take care of the bulk of my services that's why I pay the large premiums so that I have less out of pocket expenses even when I'm following the guidelines of my health plan going to the providers on my health plan and doing the best to follow the rules I feel that the odds are stacked against me there is no way I can avoid these surprise costs and it's an expense and it's at the expense of my financial security I did all the right things and I made all the right decisions I am a person of moderate means. 
 40:22
My husband died three years ago and we depend on his retirement benefits I'm fortunate that because of that I'm able to focus on caring for our son and making sure he is taken care of and provide provided for the way his dad intended I thought I had good insurance last year of his life weighs over thirteen thousand dollars for it even with insurance if I had not been able to negotiate a reduction of this bill and several others they would have wiped me out even selling my house would not have taken care of all of it and we would have had no place to live what does a family less fortunate than me do maybe they have benefits from both start their jobs if there is a double income family maybe they don't what happens when their child needs is need specialized pediatric care and the only providers are out of network and here because I'm concerned about the next person who has to deal with this issue and isn't financially or emotionally prepared and doesn't have the background to know how to navigate our health care system thank you for your time today I'm grateful that you're listening to the issue and giving it the attention that it deserves and hopefully will make the changes that are necessary thank you and questions All right thank you now let's all bring up Zack Snyder Mick Jones and Len Soren and I should say we must have made some progress throughout the summer because everybody signed in other rather than crime today so I guess that's progress I have to look at it that way. 
 42:08
Chair Cody members of the Committee for the record I make Jones on behalf of the Association of Washington health care pliant plans and as you said we are signed in as other on House bill ten sixty five on behalf of our members I want to express the fact that we support efforts to ban balance or surprise billing where an out of network provider member demands payment from their patient above the amount paid under the patient's health care coverage House bill ten sixty five provides a good framework to address this problem and we appreciate the opportunities provided by the bill's sponsor to provide common input on the bill based on the bill before us however the associations membership does have some concerns that we ask the sponsor to address the bill currently bans balance or surprise billing for all out of network providers and facilities we ask that an exclusion be written into the bill for situations where in rolling knowingly in voluntarily receive services out of network when and then work option is available and that the bill protect those who receive out of network services in an emergency situation where they have no control over the provider scheduled or assigned by the hospital to perform surgery or other services. 
 43:19
We would also note that our members report member complaints about balance billing by ambulance service providers and we again would like to reiterate as we have over the summer in working with folks that that those services be included in the bill another concern that we'd like to share involves the provision in Section eight of the bill permitting an arbitrator to review multiple claims for similar or related C.P.T. codes for procedures performed within three months of each other we ask that each claim be considered on its own merit which is how in network claims are processed normally for in network providers in addition by permitting out of network providers to collect claims and present them in a group there is a lot lower incentive for them to actually negotiate an appropriate and reasonable commercial rate with carriers because they will just wait for arbitration and deal with that. 
 44:12
That adds administrative costs that are unnecessary to the system and we think an easy solution is to simply eliminate the bundling and the bill we would again like to express our appreciation of the sponsor for working with us on this issue and we look forward to an acceptable resolution. 
 44:28
We need and we want to express again our support for a solution to balance filling that doesn't incentivize providers or facilities to remain out of network that protect certain Rowley's from services when they're at their most vulnerable and is not necessarily at administrative costs Thank you. 
 44:46
And I think Madam Chair members like maybe Lance or and on behalf of from Arab across with you today joining Meghan Zach in testifying other I think for the first time on a balance billing Bill. 
 45:00
We first chair Cody and I and a number of others were first in a room talking about this I think in two thousand and ten down your county Yes You know well and it's been a while and I appear before you today I think with a greater sense of optimism about our ability to collectively reach a conclusion that number one and most importantly takes consumers out of the middle of these sorts of disputes we don't want any more stories like Mrs Hanson told you today and nor does anyone else in the room. 
 45:32
We do think it's important number one the members be taken out of the middle and that number two we don't unduly disrupt the contracting dynamic so that health plans are able to continue to build robust networks to service our members. 
 45:48
We look forward to continuing our conversations with the chair with the insurance commissioner and others and we're very hopeful that we can come out of the session this year with the bill doing away with this with this practice Thank you care Codee members of the committee as Exide are appearing today on behalf of Regents Blue Shield like my colleagues on the panel have said were here other but hopeful that we can find a solution this session to finally end the practice of balance billing and like others have said take the member out of the middle so we hope to continue working with you and I don't need to reiterate the points but disagree with my colleagues up here thank you OK thank you for. 
 46:33
Granted Chris dandy. 
 46:51
Good afternoon Madam Chair members of committee for the record Shawn Graham with the Washington State Medical Association here signed and also as other on house built in sixty five and I want to knowledge you know I think we've had conversations with you know basically everybody who's up here on this issue and I know that we've testified many times on this is you have to little bit of like like The Who or something like we're on a farewell tour that just you know there's an end I hope it's a farewell tour. 
 47:17
This is and that's you know it's underscore the point that's been made by others I think we share the optimism that this year we can get this resolved this is and remains it has been and remains a priority issue for the Washington State Medical Association. 
 47:32
And the focus that we've brought into it is kind of twofold agreeing on wanting to take the patients out of the middle that they shouldn't be subject to these situations and also maintaining those incentives to contract physicians have a lot of natural incentives to contract and it's need we need that the legislative solution to keep those in place for both sides I know we did some research of our own over the interim talking to our counterparts in states that have passed balanced bill in bills and came to a similar conclusion that legislation that focuses on creating a structure where you're incenting the two sides to come to contract rather than trying to fix a rate or mechanism in statute real. 
 48:15
Scenario that retains those incentives to contract there are a couple of elements of the bill that we are particularly pleased to see retained the one that has been mentioned previously the claims bundling component allowing providers and facilities to consider multiple claims in arbitration at one time it's very important because oftentimes the discrepancy is going to be fairly nominal on a claim by claim basis but over the course of several weeks or months the accumulation of that is going to be considerable So if you were to try to arbitrate this on a claim by claim big. 
 48:50
This the cost of arbitration would outstrip the difference between what the reimbursement is and what the the bill is so that ability that efficiency in trying to in being able to consider them concurrently bundling those claims is very important the other piece is important this is come up in a number of ways already in this hearing is the never got to proceed component of the bill is something that we feel very strongly about and appreciate the improved protections around network adequacy asking the insurance commissioner to consider that situation where if a carrier is contracted with a hospital are they also contracted with the physicians who are working in the hospital we do have I mean we are signing other we do have some suggestions some pieces that we would like to continue to work on the initial reimbursement that is to Pilate in the bill we want to make sure that there is no loaded language that's balanced that it doesn't favor one side or the other we need to make sure that the transparency components in the bill are workable for providers and facilities and yield a couple of other components to my colleague from the hospital association but just want to end on noting that again this is something that we are confident that we can resolve this session and we are committed to doing so so really appreciate your consideration. 
 50:07
Thank you Madam Chair members of the committee Chris family here before you today on behalf of the Washington State Hospital Association we are joining the other parade on this legislation and I would echo honestly a lot of the comments that have been made by all of those of testified thus far in wanting to say thank you Madam Chair and to the office of insurance commissioner for the work they've done on this legislation that you've done in this legislation over the past year I think that the structure of the bill that we have before us today is greatly improved from the previous versions and that I think it does help take the consumer out of the middle and establishes something pretty close to a fair process for mitigating disputes and they do happen that said we do of course have a couple of concerns I do agree with everything that the medical association mentioned and would add to it to say couple areas where we'd like to continue the conversation of the first being the inclusion of Medicare as one the arbitration criteria the reimbursement of the bill is stipulated as commercially reasonable I believe is the term used and I think is widely acknowledged there's a pretty big gap between what Medicare reimburses and what commercial insurance reimburses for services so for us having That is an arbitration criteria doesn't really doesn't really make sense with trying to get to what would be a fair commercial reimbursement for the services rendered the second area is around the self funded plans I think Jane mentioned that this version of legislation allows self funded plans are self funded employers I should say to opt into the legislation which we have no problem with we just continue to be confused as to how are our members hospitals and providers are supposed to know whether someone who comes in through our doors is on a self funded plan or a fully insured plan where the protections do obviously apply it's not it's an insurance card as an insurance card it doesn't specify whether it's a Starbucks or you know a small manufacturing company that's fully insured so we're only asking that the bill put in for some to put in place some sort of process to make sure that our members can identify when this law applies and when it doesn't I would mention that the state we're. 
 52:06
Copying this from New Jersey in the rulemaking is requiring the insurer I believe is in court requiring insurance companies to add to both their insurance cards and to the payment remittance when they see whatever out of network amount they send letting the provider know whether or not the law there applies in that situation so again if you think this bill is moved in a positive direction and we are happy to continue being part of the conversation thank you Robin Schmidt has a question for you so why do you need to know when someone comes in whether their self funded plan and not is that a ticket to balance Bill thank you for the question Representative to make I would answer it this way I would say that this law sets inside this law has two parts the first of which is that it bans balance billing in certain situations and the second is that it puts in place a process for the provider to be reimbursed for the certain services they provided out of network if we only know one half of that equation which is that we care if only one half of that equation is in is being applied to Van On balance billing and the other half isn't that's not really I would say fair to the provider for the goal is for women out of network claim half happens in the consumer protection from balance billing for there to be some sort of fairy embarrassment to the provider if we don't know whether that person that whether that patient can or cannot be balance billed then we run the risk of having ours our claim sense of apartment health which is not something we really want to do so I have a question for both of you I guess. 
 53:36
Another option that has come that California has some of the hospitals in California are mandating that any doctor that practices in their hospital has to belong to the networks that the hospital belongs to have you guys considered that the two of you discuss that to a degree I know I've seen media saying that some hospital systems have adopted the policy I would note a couple of things this one this bill does help address that issue that network adequacy requirement that's included in the bills specifically ask the insurance commissioner's office to when a network is submitted if the hospital is contracted with the carrier that you need to look at the component parts of the hospital and make sure that they're in contracted status too so I think that that would go a long way to addressing it and I would know that there's you know there's a difference between a hospital setting that is a policy that a provider group would know upon taking you know upon and being employed or you know contracting with that facility and the state setting that in statute I think from again that incentive to contract. 
 54:51
Standpoint it would put the physician groups in a very difficult spot if there was a state law requiring their participation in the same networks as the hospitals I would just add to what Shawn said that most hospitals in Washington not all of them do strongly encourage the providers that not employ providers that work at their facilities to contract to the same insurance companies that they do however I would say that the hospitals are number one goal in trying in staffing their hospitals to staff it with high quality physicians to provide the care that our patients need. 
 55:26
That would later. 
 55:29
Any Brackenbury civil I can never believe I could never get you're right I did OK Ruben this is even harder Chris not done I'll go first since I have the easiest last name your time that's right good afternoon Madam Chair members of the committee and Amy Brackenbury I'm here today on behalf of the Washington State Nurses Association Nurses Association takes a consumer and patient centered protection of patient protection centered approach to this issue and I strongly urge support for this piece of legislation many nurses have experienced surprise billing themselves and have experienced this issue through dealing with the patients that they care for nurses know the emotional and financial stress that it can cause. 
 56:20
That can be caused by a surprise Bill particularly what a patient thinks that they have done the right thing and gone to an in network facility and then they get hit with a surprise Bill so I'm just going to be brief and say we think it's time to pass this bill I agree with the it's named gentleman from the Medical Association it's time to take the patients out of the middle of this and pass this bill once and for all thank you very much Steve. 
 56:46
OK. 
 56:47
Hello Madam Chair and committee members My name is simple I'm here on behalf of SCI you health care and I have to say the last thing Oh don't I have to be civil Hippel eat yeah hopefully rhymes with street. 
 57:02
So civil hip elite with SCI you health care eleven ninety nine Northwest where Union of thirty thousand health care and mental health workers across Washington state and we strongly support House bill ten sixty five we're really enthusiastic about this commonsense fix for surprise billing like many others have said we've been working on this for a long time we're excited to have a solution. 
 57:25
We want to make sure that patients don't get financially penalized when they struggle to navigate a complicated healthcare system and are unfairly stuck with bills that no fault of their own. 
 57:37
And some of the things that we especially appreciate about this bill are that it creates a simple and consistent formula for patients to understand their caution responsibility for critical services. 
 57:50
And that it uses available data resources to help resolve disputes among carriers and providers so again we really support this bill it will help all of our members who are who are public employees and also for those who are self and self insured plans it also offers them the opportunity to enjoy protection from surprise bills Thank you. 
 58:16
OK thank you to the members of the committee met in German Dr Ruben Christian and the Washington State Radiological Society. 
 58:23
The WS R.S.S. we like to call ourselves is committed to the intent of the bill and we come in under the other category simply because we recommend one minute change agreed we ourselves are people we buy insurance and we can get sick so we'd like to know that we are covered by our policies to the W S R S recommends changes to strengthen the bill by removing references to Medicare rates when reimbursement is disputed Medicare rates are often extremely low they are not necessarily set by market conditions that pertain to the area in which one is practicing and may not actually be relevant as far as the cost of providing care. 
 59:08
To. 
 59:10
For that particular service. 
 59:12
But we do support the intent of the bill and I ask only for minor changes. 
 59:19
Thank you all right
