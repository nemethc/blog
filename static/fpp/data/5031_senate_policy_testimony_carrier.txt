Chair Cleveland members of the committee I make JONES For the record on behalf of the Association of Washington health care plans we have signed it is other on both fifty six ninety nine and Senate bill fifty thirty one where testifying is other due to concerns with some aspects of both bills. 
 45:51
First we are concerned that fifty six ninety nine in particular contains some provisions that will undermine incentives for providers to enter into network contracts with carriers we we feel that the network provisions that and the negotiations need to encourage providers to come in network so that they're available to patients and not encourage them to stay out of network we are concerned about with that issue for both both aspects of the bill the bill's provisions permitting bundling claims for arbitration are also a concern as each claim in the payment coding for her based on the specific patient bundling creates an incentive for providers to refrain from negotiating in good faith and going instead directly to arbitration arbitrating three months of planes will increase the cost of arbitration to make them longer Finally I want to specifically address the provision about the ID cards the ID card in the network status should not be an issue when a provider is about to see a patient it should not matter to them whether or not the patient is going to be billed or could be balanced build or not and therefore we specifically object to that provision in the bill we have other areas for discussion and we'll provide those to the committee thank you we shan't that thank you. 
 47:09
Chair Cleveland members of the committee Zack Snyder on behalf of Regents Blue Shield I'm here today a concern or other both fifty thirty one and fifty six ninety nine you know I believe we're closer than ever this year as some other stakeholders have said we've been working with the framework that was put forward in fifty thirty one and we think that is the right framework to move forward on one of the areas we. 
 47:32
Our concern with is the evidence that is submitted to the arbitrator that Senator Oban brought up one of the things here is that in fifty six ninety nine there is no provision for Medicare rates and you have billed charges Bill charges can be sometimes four or five times or even more of Medicare and Medicare is our nation's largest pair so we would asked to add both for some kind of balance when the arbitrator takes a look at the evidence emitted Thank you. 
 48:03
I'm sorry chair Cleveland members or committee Len sort of baffled Primera sharing. 
 48:10
This testimony with concerns on the bill as have Meg and Zach I want to first of all concur with everything they've shared and I want to focus in on one issue in fifty six ninety nine and that is the inclusion of the network adequacy standards as they relate to these hospital based specialties. 
 48:27
In the event of a health plan has a network adequacy issue what the health plan will typically do is go out and contract with some more providers to build out the network to resolve the adequacy issue in the context of hospital based providers we can't do that we can't go and find three new anesthesiologists groups for a hospital and call the hospital and say Here we've got all of these new contract and it's easy ologist for you the hospital chooses in a city Z. ologists who will administer anesthesiology to patients we can't build out that network it is fixed by the group with whom the hospital has the agreement with so we think network adequacy standards are frankly not possible to comply with or to deal with because we can't simply choose to contract with more providers in the event there are non contract and hospital based providers in the system thank you thank you three of you being here and oh. 
 49:27
Oh.

Senator Frank good to have a question I do to very briefly to do it the other states I know this is an issue not just in Washington other states have been other states set up an arbitration system akin to what's being proposed in this legislation and if so what's the experience been I think with other states in terms of how many claims actually get arbitrated under that system we can get to some reports related to that and I believe the office of the insurance commissioner can probably speak to it as well the other the bills in other states don't combine this type of arbitration with the other provisions of the bill typically so it will what do they do would necessarily be an apples to apples comparison what do they do depending on the state they do different things so in general so for example in California or in Texas for example there is a limitation that's placed in on the parties go to arbitration and what they found is that there were there was discrepancies in terms of how the bills were being prepared so more people were being balanced build rather than fewer as a result of the arbitration they're fixing that now New York has a different schematic so we can send you those details.
