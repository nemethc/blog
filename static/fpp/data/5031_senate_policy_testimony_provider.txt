Means Madam Chair members of the Committee for the record Shawn Graham of the have of the Washington State Medical Association speaking to both bills we had signed in other on fifty thirty one and supportive on fifty six ninety nine for those of you who are who've been on the committee you know that we've we've talked about this issue over the past past few years and for those who haven't congratulations on this in more contentious iterations I think that we're closer than ever to a solution here and all through the focus for the motions that Medical Association has been on finding a resolution that takes patients out of the middle and minimizes in the incident a disproportionate impact on incentives to contract to scuse me both bills contain some important elements the ability to bundle claims when there is a dispute so that you can concurrently consider multiple claims in arbitration they also consider They also include network adequacy protections in particular Senate bill fifty six ninety nine just a couple quick elements that want to speak to that are important for the position community I was a question about the inclusion of Medicare as a consideration for an arbitrator we feel that as the arbitrator is determining what a commercially reasonable rate of payment would be that it is inappropriate for them to be explicitly considering Medicare rates although the parties could submit that if they felt inclined there's also the transparency provision or the difference in the transparency in fifty six ninety nine we need to make sure that that's workable for physicians and I'll defer to Chris for other elements.

Thank you madam that Madam Chair members of the Committee for the record here I'm half the Washington State Hospital Sosias and also speaking to both Senate bill fifty thirty one and Senate bill fifty six ninety nine we are light medical So see it in other on fifty thirty one in support fifty six ninety nine very very briefly centrifuge thirty one does represent a improvement over previous years structures of this legislation and we do appreciate the work of the insurance commissioner's office and others to bring it to a much better place than we've seen in years and years past however that it does still need some improvement in our opinion it is it does not fix what we call the Arista issue where providers you know that as you heard the bill report self funded plans can opt into the protections of this legislation however providers don't know whether someone is on a self funded plan or a fully insured plan seems like an important distinction to know Senate bill fifty six ninety nine does include provisions to make sure providers would be aware of the whether a patient is on that kind of plan or not but also mention that fifty six ninety nine includes an impression important provision around or of requiring carriers to tell their enroll is if they're really asked the network status of the non employed providers at a hospital that carrier is listing as in network given that that's the aim of this builder event balance billing in those situations and you name we share the hospital association we think it would be important for carriers enrollees to have that information available to them if they so choose thank you very much thank you you.
