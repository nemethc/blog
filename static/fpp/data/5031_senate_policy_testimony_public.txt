Good afternoon thank you for your patience in particular Mrs Hanson driving here from Vancouver today thank you for waiting and thank you for being here and chair Cleveland members of the Committee thanks so much for the opportunity to testify I am going to yield my time to Mrs Hanson and we will provide written responses to all of the questions that were raised because it's more important for you to hear from her than me thank you very much. 
 51:44
Good afternoon Madam Chair and the members of the committee My name is Jamie Hansen thank you for the opportunity to speak I will try to keep this in the time allotted I did have prepared comments so you're catching me laugh and you can feel free to submit those prepared comments to staff and we'll all see those OK thank you thank you very much in a nutshell my son was seen in an interview in that work emergency room facility this last summer he ended up having to be transported to a hospital for pediatric care that was not available I was told at the hospital he was being seen so we were transported to Randall Children's Network he ended up with a four day stay in the pick you a couple of additional days and in their hospital before he was discharged his home now and doing fine. 
 52:33
After that happened of course we've started receiving the bills and to shorten the story I ended up with about one hundred ten thousand dollars in medical bills ninety six of that was the balance billing from Randall children's facility and the health plan had only paid a little over fifteen thousand that was there in network level. 
 52:59
I'm I'm sorry I'm. 
 53:02
Not quite all right you take your time glad that your son is well now I think you know under. 
 53:10
I guess that I am the the gist of it on my own for three. 
 53:18
It's in reverse as a question yes siree. 
 53:23
I'm happy you're here safe and sound and some senators trip all over themselves up there so don't you worry but here's my question for you. 
 53:34
You had network coverage that was actually in the Seattle area didn't you for your health care well in mind the my spectator was that in an emergency situation you were expected to transport your child all the way up to Seattle rather than across the river about twenty minutes for us were neighbors to. 
 53:59
To Portland for lifesaving activities for your son right that's never been that's never been specifically said to me I still don't know what hospital that would be up in this area but that's my understanding is that in order to stay in network I would have had to come very far north I mean listen our Washington just thirty minutes outside of Vancouver so that's and Portland's a man so forty five minute drive into downtown Portland not two hours and you know when he was transported by ambulance from his health to Randall so I don't know if you're if the health plan is going to pay for a two hour ambulance ride or are they going to Life Flight him he had a heart infection it was very serious a heart and a pelvic infection so he wasn't just a basic you know situation he was very serious. 
 54:52
Jamie thank you so much for being here today appreciate it I remember hearing from you back earlier this summer and I want you to know that a lot of what's happening here is because of you so thank you thank you very much and thank you for your time and this is handsome man I ask of the bills that you received what services were you balance billed for. 
 55:13
The entire hospital was ninety six thousand dollars I paid a portion of the ambulance services I paid a portion of he saw three different. 
 55:22
Yes or enter all the justice pediatric gastroenterologists in the hospital so I paid the balance of those bills he also saw a pediatric cardiologist during his stay and I paid the balance I was bounced build on that and I was bounced billed for radiology consultants was another provider and various individual doctors who saw him or perform tests while he was inpatient and so it was those folks who were out of network that triggered that everyone that was associated with the Randall stay was out of that work they were all in or a get in life wise does not participate or have any providers in Oregon any longer so that leaves Clark County in kind of a stuck situation I mean I'm sure there's a lot of counties that that applies to but that's the where I live so thank you
