#Balance billing reform has been an exercise in patience, politics, and good policy. Now, all the hard work is paying off. 

#Why Balance Billing?

##Both personal and academic

> * Recent family experience
> * Healthcare policy nerd

# What is Balance Billing and how does HB 1065 fix it?

## Anatomy of an Emergency Room Bill
 Balance billing is just one part of the equation.

###ER Cost Data
#nodes
links <- read_csv("data/final_er_costs.csv")

# From these flows we need to create a node data frame: it lists every entities involved in the flow
nodes <- data.frame(name=c(as.character(links$source), as.character(links$target)) %>% unique())
 
# With networkD3, connection must be provided using id, not using real name like in the links dataframe.. So we need to reformat it.
links$IDsource <- match(links$source, nodes$name)-1 
links$IDtarget <- match(links$target, nodes$name)-1
 
# Make the Network
sankeyNetwork(Links = links, Nodes = nodes,
              Source = "IDsource", Target = "IDtarget",
              Value = "value", NodeID = "name", units = "dollars",

##HB 1065 removes the patient from the middle of the contract dispute between hospitals and service providers. 

> * Providers are prohibited from balance billing patients
> * Carriers must pay *a commercially reasonable amount, based on payments for the same or similar services provided in a similar geographic area*
> * Network status information must be provided to patients
> * If agreement cannot be reached on reasonable payments, provider and carrier go to arbitration

##The **Problem** stream is accelerating
Media matters— Sarah Kliff at Vox conducted a year-long report on excessive balance bills.

*Can you guess the...* 

>* Name of the most egregious balance biller in California?
>* Highest reported cost of an ibuprofen tablet?
>* Cost of an ice pack and bandage, no doctor required?

##Strong **Political** Support

## The **Policy** stream is surging

#Stakeholders

##Converging policy reveals divergent interests
> * ***Patients*** don't want to pay these bills anymore
> * ***OIC*** wants a win on one of their signature issues
> * ***Carriers*** want to increase member goodwill without costs
> * ***Providers*** want to make money


##The farewell tour begins

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
commonality.cloud(tdm, random.order=FALSE, scale=c(5, .5),colors = viridis(n = 4, direction = -1, end = .8), max.words=400)
```




## Each group has distinct concerns
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
comparison.cloud(tdm, random.order=FALSE, scale=c(5, .5),colors = viridis(n = 4, direction = -1, end = .8), max.words=400)
```


# In the House

## Passed out of policy committee with two nays
Amended to reduce bundling of arbitration claims to two, rather than three months
 
## Passed out of fiscal committee with three nays
Amended to provide additional information to patients and hospitals on insurance cards
 
##Passed the floor 84-13 with strong bipartisan support
Exclusively Republican nays, but strong testimony in support given by both parties. 

# In the Senate

## SB 5031, Companion to 1065, Died in Policy Committee
<p style="text-align: center;">***RIP*** </p>

## Senate Health & Long Term Care replaced 5031 with 5699
>* 5699 was structurally similar to 5031
>* However, all points of dispute resolved in favor of providers and hospitals
>* It died in fiscal committee
>* ***RIP***

## **2SHB 1065** in the Senate— *Coming Soon to TVW Near You!*
Scheduled for public hearing on Friday. Stay tuned.

##The bill is close, but not perfect
>* Currently, self-funded plans can choose opt in
>* Federal legislation would be needed to make participation required
>* Ambulance services are not covered, and remain very expensive

#Thanks to public interest and agency effort, it looks like HB 1065 will pass. But as we all know, nothing is for certain.
